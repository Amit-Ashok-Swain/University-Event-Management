## Data Validation in the Model Layer

The project enforces rigorous data validation in the model layer to maintain data integrity and consistency. Below are the key data validations applied to the student and event models:

### Student Model

#### Student ID

- **Validation:** Auto-generated by the database (Primary Key)
- **Description:** The `studentId` is automatically generated by the database and serves as the primary key for student records.

#### First Name and Last Name

- **Validation:** `@Pattern(regexp = "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*$", message = "Only alphabets are allowed with the first letter as capital")`
- **Description:** The `firstName` and `lastName` fields must start with a capital letter and contain only alphabetic characters.

#### Age

- **Validation:** `@Min(value = 18)`, `@Max(value = 25)`
- **Description:** The `age` field must be between 18 and 25.

#### Department

- **Validation:** Enumerated values (ME, ECE, CIVIL, CSE)
- **Description:** The `studentDepartment` field must have one of the predefined department values: ME, ECE, CIVIL, CSE.

### Event Model

#### Event ID

- **Validation:** Auto-generated by the database (Primary Key)
- **Description:** The `eventId` is automatically generated by the database and serves as the primary key for event records.

#### Event Name

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `eventName` field does not have additional validation as it represents the name of the event.

#### Location of Event

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `locationOfEvent` field does not have additional validation as it represents the location of the event.

#### Date

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `eventDate` field does not have additional validation as it represents the date of the event.

#### Start Time and End Time

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `startTime` and `endTime` fields do not have additional validation as they represent the event's start and end times.

These comprehensive data validations ensure that the university event management system captures accurate and reliable information.

## Data Flow

### Controller

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for various operations on student and event records.

```java
@RestController

    StudentService studentService;

    // Add a student
    @PostMapping("student")
    public String addAStudent(@RequestBody Student student) {
        return studentService.addAStudent(student);
    }

    // Get all students
    @GetMapping("students")
    public Iterable<Student> getAllStudents() {
        return studentService.getAllStudents();
    }

    // ...
}
```
#### Student Controller

    @Autowired
    IStudentRepo studentRepo;

    public String addAStudent(Student student) {
        studentRepo.save(student);
        return "A student is added!";
    }
